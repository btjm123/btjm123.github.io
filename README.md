# Nature Injustice

### Motivation

The game was a collabrative team effort by my team of four and was for a game competition, Singapore Games Creation Competition 2017. We successfully entered into finals as top 30 amongst hundreds of submissions of other games. Eventually, we obtained the Commendation Award from the contest.

### Excerpt of the code

Code responsible for calculating the kinematics and collison of the black trashbag in every frame. 

### Synopsis

Favouring convenience by littering and failing to protect the environment has only resulted in things going terribly wrong. In the year of 2065, trash bags have somehow gone alive and invaded the once-vibrant city of TofuNators, causing the city to descend in anarchy. It has come the time for you to stop this and to restore order and peace in the city.

Aligned with the theme of the ’The Eco Knight Rises’, you must jump over the trash bags in order to destroy them before they destroy you! Composed of a simple plat-former level and a ’Survive the Wave of Trash Bags’ level, you will be engaged with this well thought-out and face-paced game. Music was also included to provide a more wholesome player experience. This new version features shorter plat-former level and a shorter 'Wave' level, so that you can get right into the meat of this game - a brand new boss level.

This boss level is packed with explosions, screen shakes, power ups, and a host lot more that is guaranteed to wow. Besides focusing on the fun factor, we also focus on the educational aspect - making it relevant to the theme. We have a simple, yet fun quiz in the midst of this action-packed level, designed to educate the younger ones on the concept of environment.

Have fun with the game!

### Current Known Bugs

1. The kinematics of the first level is rather awry. Player would get stuck to a particular platform and would be able to "teleport".
2. This bug is a lot more glaring - no background music and sound effects. We implemented the sounds feature but for some reason, we are unable to produce any sound when exporting to HTML5 :( It would have been a lot more epic should the lack of sounds have been fixed.
